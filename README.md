# Automated Domain Control Validation Renewal

This application allows you to automatically (re)perform domain control validation using the Entrust API and your DNS provider.

## Config

| Environment variable            | Value                                                     |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `DNS_PROVIDER`                  | The name of your default DNS provider                     |
| `ENTRUST_API_CERTIFICATE`       | PEM encoded client certificate                            |
| `ENTRUST_API_PRIVATE_KEY`       | PEM encoded private key                                   |
| `ENTRUST_API_USERNAME`          | API Username                                              |
| `ENTRUST_API_PASSWORD`          | API Password (API Key)                                    |
| `DURATION_BEFORE_EXPIRY`        | Optional, remaining validity before starting revalidation |

Each DNS provider has its own set of environment variables.

## Obtaining credentials

### Entrust

These credentials can be obtained via the Entrust Certificate Services Enterprise Portal (Enterprise Portal, Administration > Advanced Settings > API). In order to obtain an account and related credentials, you must have an active subscription or other entitlement from Entrust for Entrust Certificate Services (ECS).

### DNS Provider(s)

This project is utilizing the DNS providers of the LEGO ACME client; documentation can be found here:
https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/#dns-providers

In addition to the default DNS provider specified in `DNS_PROVIDER`, alternative DNS providers can be specified on a per domain basis by setting the environment variable `DNS_PROVIDER_example_com` where the suffix `example_com` stands for `example.com` and can be replaced by any domain in your account.

# Security

Both the Entrust and the DNS provider credentials provide strong entitlements and can have a devastating impact to your organisation or service when not secured properly. Itâ€™s your sole responsibility to store these credentials securely and restrict API credentials to the resources and capabilities this tool requires.

# Example

```sh
export ENTRUST_API_CERTIFICATE=`cat cert.pem`
export ENTRUST_API_PRIVATE_KEY=`cat key.pem`
export ENTRUST_API_USERNAME=
export ENTRUST_API_PASSWORD=

# Provide the API credentials for your DNS provider
export CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN=
export CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_API_TOKEN=

docker run --name dvrenewal --rm \
    -e DNS_PROVIDER=cloudflare \
    -e CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN \
    -e CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_API_TOKEN \
    -e ENTRUST_API_CERTIFICATE \
    -e ENTRUST_API_PRIVATE_KEY \
    -e ENTRUST_API_USERNAME \
    -e ENTRUST_API_PASSWORD \
    -e DURATION_BEFORE_EXPIRY \
